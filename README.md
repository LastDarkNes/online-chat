This is a my simple pet-project that I used to learn features of Django, PostgreSQL and Docker.

## Installation
### Requirements
* docker
* docker-compose

### Initialization

Use this command to initialize and run the project.

```bash
./cli init
```

## Usage

### Command line interface
There is a ./cli file in a project root. You could use it to manage the project.
Use this command to view all functionality:

```bash
./cli help
```

## Contributing
It's my own project that created to show my programming skill's, so I will update it by myself. But you can use it as blog template if you want.
